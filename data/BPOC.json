      "explanation": "This federal appellate court case established important precedent regarding the reasonableness of warning shots and officer liability. The court held that firing warning shots can create unreasonable danger to bystanders and that officers must consider the totality of circumstances, including location and potential for harm, before discharging a firearm. Most law enforcement agencies now prohibit or severely restrict warning shots due to liability concerns stemming from this and similar cases."

This distance was chosen because it represents a typical engagement range for law enforcement shotgun use, balancing accuracy requirements with realistic tactical scenarios. The 15-yard minimum ensures officers can effectively use the shotgun at distances where its spread pattern and stopping power are most appropriate."

This enhancement recognizes the increased danger posed to vulnerable children and carries a punishment range of 180 days to 2 years in state jail and a fine up to $10,000. While 'Endangering a Child' might also apply, DWI with Child Passenger is the specific, more serious enhancement tailored to this exact scenario."

      "explanation": "This case established the modern 'qualified immunity' standard for law enforcement officers. Under this doctrine, officers performing discretionary functions are generally immune from civil liability unless their conduct violates a federal statutory or constitutional right that was 'clearly established' at the time of the incident - meaning that a reasonable officer would have known their actions were unlawful. The immunity protects officers from frivolous lawsuits while still holding them accountable for clear violations of established law. The Supreme Court in Harlow v. Fitzgerald set the foundation for this standard, and circuit courts like the 4th Circuit in Milstead have refined its application."
